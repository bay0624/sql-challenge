I queried the database to obtain the following results:

- The employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary for each employee.
- The first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
- The manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, first name.
- The department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- The first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
- All employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- All employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- The frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name; in descending order.
